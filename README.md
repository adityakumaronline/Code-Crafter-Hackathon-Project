# Code-Crafter-Hackathon-Project
Our web based application(ENCOS) will provide market access to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) enabling growth and success in a competitive
market.
The application will be scalable, regionally adaptable and prioritize data security. 
The solution aims to revolutionize MSE operations
by enhancing market reach and efficiency. The website allows MSEs to register, create profiles, and access a wider customer base. It uses geolocation to connect users with nearby MSEs, allowing customers to search for products, apply filters, and read reviews. 
The website also offers AI-powered chat boxes, messaging, promotions, secure transactions, business analytics, community engagement, and customer support for ease of use.
